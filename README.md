# The Power Platform Pipelines Charon Framework
The Power Platform Pipelines Charon Framework is designed to help organisations adopt a healthy ALM approach using Power Platform Pipelines. Pipelines are an emerging technology, so how organisations can adopt it and should adopt it early in project lifecycles, is key for a better all round experience. This is not a how-to guide for using Power Platform Pipelines, more the strategy for implementation that enables use of Pipelines.

# Charon
Charon was the character in Greek mythology who ferried people across the river Styx and Acheron. I found this a good analogy as ALM is often a fraught, difficult, hard to navigate and sometimes hopeless ðŸ˜… But Charon guided people across, for a small fee, to the other side.

# Collaborators
This framework is derived from years of building pipelines with colleagues, gaining feedback, discussing the best practices for implementation. 

Getting ideas and feedback from others building pipelines is invaluable, not only does a healthy discussion on best practices allow us to refine these, but it help highlight areas people might not consider. Several people have helped in shaping this framework into what it is today:
